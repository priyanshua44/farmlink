        content:"<p>Sustainability is still one of the major trends in agribusiness. The reason is that agriculture produces one-quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Today, agricultural companies want to take responsibility and reduce that share. In addition, consumer demand for organic and environmentally friendly produce is rising. This is forcing agribusinesses to start farming in a more sustainable way.Vertical farming technology seems to be an answer. And in short, it is. But only when you use it correctly. Read further to find out how to make growing plants in vertical farms sustainable.</p><h2>Vertical farming technology and controlled environment agriculture</h2><p>Vertical farming is more than just stacking trays with soil and seeds on top of each other. And it isn’t about building a greenhouse in a shipping container. In reality, it’s all about nurturing plants in a perfect environment.</p><h3>What is controlled environment agriculture?</h3><p>In controlled environment agriculture (CEA), farmers maintain optimal growing conditions for crops by monitoring and controlling vital parameters such as temperature, lighting, and water use. Controlled environment agriculture allows farmers to grow green produce all year long, no matter the season. But what’s even more important is that it saves significant resources, since you always use only the exact amount needed of a given resource.</p><h3>How vertical farming works</h3><p>How does vertical farming work? Vertical farming, or vertical agriculture, is a subset of the CEA method. It takes the concept of maintaining optimal growing conditions and marries it with a vertical indoor setting. The result is a vertical farm with crops growing on top of each other and environmental parameters controlled by advanced technology. Such farms can wisely use all resources, including soil, water, and chemicals. In fact, an indoor vertical farm uses approximately 95% less water than a traditional farm. So yes, that combination was made in heaven.</p><h3>Reducing the environmental impact</h3><p>Precise use of resources is a way for agribusinesses to become more environmentally friendly. The fewer resources farming consumes, the fewer GHG emissions it produces. Vertical farming technologies allow for growing more plants per square acre of land while recapturing and recycling irrigation water. Moreover, a vertical farm that can be set anywhere cuts the need for transportation.</p>"

        content:`<p>Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world and wheat farming requires proper planning to produce a high yield.</p><p>Most farmers prefer growing wheat in winter when the average temperature is between 18-24 degree Celsius. However, farmers who reside in extremely cold climates prefer the spring season as it allows enough sunlight for the wheat crop to flourish.</p><p><strong>Seven tips for successful wheat seeding and farming for maximum yield:</strong></p><p>1: Pick a dry area for cultivation: Wheat is both a spring and winter crop, and utilizes at least 8 hours of sun on a daily basis. Therefore, avoid picking a site that’s too shady and doesn’t allow enough sunlight.</p><p>2: Prepare the land well in advance: Growing wheat requires prepping the soil for strong root growth. Till your soil to a depth of at least 15 cm, and make sure that it’s even.</p><p>3: Spread the wheat seeds in a semi-circular motion: You can always use a seed spreader too, as long as it spreads the seeds at approximately one seed per 2.5 sq. cm.</p><p>4: Use phosphorus, nitrogen &amp; Potassium fertilization: Phosphorus and nitrogen collectively help develop strong roots which will help the wheat crop survive winter. Optimum dose of Mahadhan 12:32:16 (75 Kg/ac) can help wheat growers to get more yield. In addition to this, application of Mahadhan Bensulf (10 kg/ac) &amp; Mahadhan Zinc sulphate (10 Kg/ac) can further help wheat farmers to get quality oriented higher yield fetching better market price. However, note that excessive nitrogen fertilization can have adverse effects on the crop’s sustenance.</p><p>5: Water right after planting the seeds: Winter wheat crops require water as soon as the seeds are planted. It is imperative to keep the entire planting area moist until the plant begins to develop. Then on, follow a strict irrigation schedule.</p><p>6: Follow an irrigation schedule: For maximum yield of wheat crop, an irrigation schedule of 6 stages post sowing is highly recommended:</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>1st irrigation – 3-4 weeks</li><li>2nd irrigation – 40-45 days</li><li>3rd irrigation – 60-65 days</li><li>4th irrigation – 80-85 days</li><li>5th irrigation – 100-105 days</li><li>6th irrigation – 105-120 days</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7: Use pesticides and insecticides as necessary: Wheat crop is not averse to slugs and insects that can wreak havoc on the plantation, especially when the wheat is still very short. Use chemicals like Chlorpyrifos and acetamiprid in such a case that effectively manage the insects.</p><p>Now that you know how to obtain the best wheat produce, why not explore Mahadhan’s extensive range of high-quality fertilisers that ensure maximum yield of your crops?</p>`

        content:`<p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Grapes are round, succulent and delicious fruits that are in high demand during the humid summer months in India. Not only are these fruits delicious, but they are also said to be amongst the most profitable crops to be grown. This is why India has accelerated its grape production and now accounts amongst the top 10 grape-producing countries in the world. Though not all of these grapes are meant for direct consumption. Over 80% of the grapes grown globally are used for wine production.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">In India, grapes are grown between October to January. This is where the spring season transitions to the winter months. Oftentimes the grapes are also grown between June to July. Ideally, grapes flourish best in hot and dry climates. Conditions of high humidity usually hurt the production due to a rise in diseases in the plant.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">The most lucrative regions in India for growing grapes are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Mizoram. If you ever travel through these regions, you can see vast trenches of grapevines where grapes are grown. These regions have proven to give high yields since the soil and climatic conditions aid the production of grapes. It’s also important to know that grape harvests are completely and consistently irrigated. Disruptions in irrigation may lead to low-quality harvests.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Thus, with adequate irrigation, good weather and soil conditions, the plant bear fruit once in a year. A key marker of identifying whether the fruit is ready to be plucked or has ripened is when the tip changes colour and acquires a sweet flavor. Different grape varieties are grown in India such as Bangalore Blue, Thompson Seedless, Dilkhush Grapes, Sharad Seedless Grapes which mature at different times.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Grape cultivation though highly profitable, is an exhaustive exercise. Multiple factors influence the quality and volume of production. Sometimes though losses are incurred when the grape plant is infected. In the next section, we will learn more about specific <a href="https://www.dhanuka.com/crops/grape">fungal diseases</a> that can spell catastrophe for the grape plant.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 14px;">Downy Mildew in Grapes </strong></p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">The biggest threat to the grape plant is Downy Mildew. It is a dangerous fungus that attacks the all-green part of the plant. What makes it threatening is that it is an air-borne fungus transferred from one plant to the other via spores. This means that if a plant has been infected, then the entire plantation might get infected very soon. One of the reasons for the growth of this fungus is wet weather conditions. Unprecedented showers cause the leaves to hold water for longer durations leading to the rise of this fungal disease.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Downy Mildew usually begins in the form of blotches on plants. These can be of different colours from pale yellow to brown. Right underneath these blotches, a ‘cotton-like mould can be seen growing in shades of grey, white or purple. Downy mildew can severely impact the plants by stunting their growth and causing the leaves to turn brown and become shrivelled. Often cultivators use organic control methods that involve removing severely infected plants, giving more air space between plants to avoid the growth of weeds, watering plants during the day when evaporation is high, so the plants don’t remain wet in order to control this fungal disease.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Downy Mildew, if not controlled or recognized early on, can destroy the entire vineyard.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 14px;">Powdery Mildew in Grapes </strong></p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Powdery Mildew is often confused with Downy Mildew since both fungi have similar traits and effects on plants. Powdery Mildew usually affects the stem, flowers and fruits. Powdery Mildew is a fungal disease that frequently occurs in the grape plant. Unlike the Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew thrives in a dry atmosphere, with low lighting and high humidity levels. These conditions are usually prevalent during early summers which is when the fungal disease is at its peak.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Powdery Mildew is also harder to identify since it has no tell-tale signs like Downy Mildew. It can be mistaken for dust in most cases, and the only telling sign is its recurrence. These usually look like white or grey spots on leaves and the stem of the plant. This fungal disease travels through the wind.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">Powdery Mildew is not very fatal if controlled in the early stages. If left untreated, it can suck nutrients from the plant, making it shrivelled and pale. The plant’s ability to protect fruits and foliage from direct sunlight is also hampered. This reduces production capacity and sometimes also affects the flavours of grapes. Farmers often clear insects, weeds and maintain garden hygiene to avoid and control the spread of Powdery Mildew.</p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;"><strong style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 14px;">Protecting Grapes from Downy Mildew and Powdery Mildew</strong></p>
        <p className="BD_sec2_SubDesc wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="2s" style=" animation-duration: 2s; animation-name: none;">The monetary losses associated with both these fungal diseases are huge. Growers often lose complete grape plantations and are left with nothing to sell. One can only imagine the turmoil that growers involved in grape production must experience when losing crops to such diseases. Fortunately, brands are producing fungicides that mitigate the risk of diseases and also help in controlling the existing spread.

        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">The symptoms of bacterial wilt infection can be seen on all parts of infected plants.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Infected plant begins to wilt, starting from the tips of the leaves or where the stems branch out, and then spreading to all parts of the plant.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Leaves become yellow at their bases, then the whole plant wilts and dies. When stems are cut a brown colored ring will be visible.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">When a tuber is cut in half, black or brown rings will, however, be visible. If left for a while or squeezed, these rings will exude a thick white fluid.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">A further symptom is fluid coming out of tuber eyes. This can be signified by soil sticking to tuber eyes when crops are harvested. Serious infection causes tubers to rot.</li>

        <strong>Disease symptoms:</strong>
        <ul>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Rhizoctonia canker occurs when stolons contact soil borne fungal bodies.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Pathogen infects plant tissue and causes stolon blinding thus reducing tuber production and yield.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">It also infects tubers causing black scurf but this is purely cosmetic, reduces tuber appearance and does not reduce yield.</li>

        <strong>Disease symptoms:</strong>
        <ul>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Potato virus Y (PVY ) is a Potyvirus, causes stipple streak. The necrotic strain generally causes mild foliage symptoms, but necrosis in the leaves of susceptible potato varieties.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Potato virus S (PVS) is a Carlavirus, if plant infected early in the season, show a slight deepening of the veins, rough leaves, more open growth, mild mottling, bronzing, or tiny necrotic spots on the leaves. PVS is transmitted by aphids non-persistently.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Potato virus X (PVX) is the type member of the Potyvirus family of plant viruses. Plants often do not exhibit symptoms, but the virus can cause symptoms of chlorosis, mosaic, decreased leaf size, and necrotic lesions in tubers.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">PVX can interact with PVY and PVS to cause more severe symptoms and yield loss than either virus alone. The source of this virus is infected tubers.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>

        <strong>Disease symptoms:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">It causes mild foliar symptoms including smaller leaves that curl downward, giving the plant a more upright growth habit. Plants can also be stunted, and leaves can be grey and distorted.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">The stems are often more branched, with the branches having sharp angles on the stem.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Tubers become narrow and spindle or oblong in shape, or more rounded than expected for a particular variety, and have prominent eyebrows.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Tubers can also become cracked or develop knobs and swellings.<img className="image-inline" className="image-inline" className="image-inline" src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-vegetables/ipm-strategies-for-potato/tuberviroid.jpg" width="399" height="164" /></li>

        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;"><img className="image-inline" className="image-inline" className="image-right" src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-vegetables/ipm-strategies-for-potato/softrotimg.jpg" width="137" height="160" />Black leg is a rot of the lower stem region. This is encouraged by cool, damp conditions.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Soft rot occurs when the bacteria gains access to the tuber through wounds &amp; other entry points.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Symptom can range from cultivator damage to fungal lesions.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">The bacteria dissolve the cell walls and liquefy the tuber invards. No distinct smell is present in true soft rot.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Survival and spread:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">The introduction of bacteria is always through a wound in the plant tissue. It can reside in plant residue for short periods. The pathogen may spread through the soil water and infected seed.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Favourable conditions:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Disease is encouraged by cool, humid conditions.</li>

        <ul>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Foliar symptoms of underground infections include wilting and chlorosis.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Tubers become infected through diseased stolons and show darkened diseased area on the skin.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">The rotted tissues remain firm and become slightly spongy.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">If the tuber is cut the tissue oxidizes to a pinkish tinge, an easy diagnostic characteristic.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <ul>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Black heart occurs primarily in storage when the tubers do not receive enough oxygen.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Blackening of the tuber center follows acute oxygen deficiency associated with either low temperature in confined storage or high field soil temperatures</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">The tissue dies from the inside out and turns jet black. Smell is absent.</li>
        <li style="color: #565656;" style="color: #565656;">Affected tubers rot later.</li>
